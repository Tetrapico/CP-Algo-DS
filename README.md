# CP-Algo-DS

The Following Codes are of problems that I solved using various Intermediate and Advanced Algorithms and data structures.
It's to be noted that, these codes are usually not meant to be written for professional uses.
It's meant to be a demonstration of the problem solving techniques I learnt and used throughout my CP journey.
Other than that many of these codes are saved for their future reusability.
If I can afford enough time, I might properly write these codes in the futures with detailed explanations on how I approached each of the problems.
